# About this site
---
Hello, I'm Jack. This site is for personal projects and things I write. I post code, tutorials, and programs here. The name "vertesine" comes from two words. "vertex" and "sine" (as in sinewave). The [ENTRIES](/entries) page is where I write "blog" stuff. It's mostly for tutorials and small code discussions, but thats a mouthful to say. The [PROJECTS](/projects) page is where I post my more serious projects.
<br><br>
If you're curious, the [site status is here](/status), and the [source code is here](https://github.com/zeroxthreef/vertesine). Anyone can create a user account if wanted. Accounts are mostly used for the commenting system.
