# Vertesine Web Files

All files for the vertesine web backend and frontend. Vertesine is my personal website that I'm currently completely remaking.

This is not finished whatsoever. I still have to credit libraries and people I took code from (especially for snowflake generation). All coming soon. This is just a quick push.
